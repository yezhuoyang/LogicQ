  MagicQ.Syntax — the magic-state protocol language (an explicit AST).

  MagicQ is a SOURCE LANGUAGE for magic-state protocols — producing, improving
  and consuming magic states while their QEC CARRIER changes over time.  It is a
  real abstract syntax (data, not Lean-embedded notation, not Lean-term-as-program):
  a `Protocol` is a named list of `ProtocolOp`s over LINEAR magic resources and
  LIVE QEC carriers.  See `MagicQ/DESIGN_PLAN.md` for the grounding in
  magic-state cultivation (Gidney–Shutty–Jones, 2409.17595) and standard 15-to-1
  distillation (Bravyi–Kitaev, quant-ph/0403025).

  REUSE over reinvention (owner directive): carriers reference the existing
  `TypeChecker.Block`/`BlockId`; logical observables reuse `PPM.PLetter`; a pending
  resource reuses `Compiler.MagicObligation`.  Only the genuinely new magic
  concepts are introduced here (magic bases, magic quality, cultivation carriers,
  postselection conditions, decoder/gap conditions, protocol ops).

  Mathlib-free (pure Bool/List/Nat/Option/String) — fast `decide` checking.

/-! ## §1. Magic bases and quality. -/

/-- A magic-state BASIS.  `T`/`Tdg` are the π/8 (`T`) states, `Y` is the
    `S`/`Y`-type state, and `A0` is the Bravyi–Kitaev `|A₀⟩ = T|+⟩` (the canonical
    15-to-1 input, equal to `T|+⟩` up to a global phase / Clifford naming —
    quant-ph/0403025 Eq. for `|A₀⟩`).  The errata around `H_XY`/sign conventions
    (2409.17595) is the reason these are tracked explicitly rather than collapsed
    into "a `T`-like state". -/
inductive MagicBasis
  | T        -- the |T⟩ = T|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + √i|1⟩)/√2 state (≡ Bravyi–Kitaev |A₀⟩ up to phase/Clifford); the π/8 cultivation target
  | Tdg      -- π/8† : T† (the |T⟩ partner with conjugate phase)
  | Y        -- S/Y-type magic state
  | A0       -- Bravyi–Kitaev |A₀⟩ = T|+⟩ (the canonical RM-15 input; the SAME state as `T`)
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- Is this a π/8 (`T`)-type basis?  `T`, `Tdg`, `A0` are all Clifford-equivalent
    `T`-type states; `Y` is the distinct `S`-type. -/
def MagicBasis.tType : MagicBasis → Bool
  | .T | .Tdg | .A0 => true
  | .Y              => false

/-- The valid INPUT basis for standard Bravyi–Kitaev 15-to-1: the `|A₀⟩ = T|+⟩`
    state (the `A`-eigenbasis input), i.e. `T` or `A0`.  `Tdg` (the conjugate `T†`)
    is NOT a standard input — it would need an explicit conjugation/normalisation op
    and obligation, not a silent relabel to `T`.  `Y` is the wrong family. -/
def MagicBasis.aType : MagicBasis → Bool
  | .T | .A0 => true
  | .Tdg | .Y => false

/-- Two bases are COMPATIBLE as a distillation/measurement input iff they are the
    same basis, or both `T`-type (so a `T`-factory accepts `T`/`Tdg`/`A0`). -/
def MagicBasis.compatible (a b : MagicBasis) : Bool :=
  (a == b) || (a.tType && b.tType)

/-- The (claimed / symbolic) QUALITY of a magic resource.  V1 is Mathlib-free, so
    real-valued error/probability claims are carried SYMBOLICALLY as strings (they
    are deferred physical obligations in this pass, never proven here); only the
    integer code/fault distances are checked structurally. -/

/-! ## §2. Carriers (reusing the typed-block representation). -/

/-- A CARRIER reference.  A `block` carrier is backed by a real `TypeChecker`
    typed block in the environment Γ (so it is genuinely checkable: liveness,
    ownership, logical arity).  An `external` carrier is an honest NAMED
    placeholder for a code family not yet materialised in ChainQ (e.g. the color
    code `ColorCode(3)` and the grafted matchable code `Matchable(d2)` — ChainQ
    has only a `ColorCode` README so far).  The checker records every `external`
    carrier as a DEFERRED obligation rather than pretending it is ChainQ-typed. -/
inductive CarrierRef
  | block    (id : TypeChecker.BlockId)
  | external (name : String)
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq, Inhabited

/-- A live QEC carrier: which code it currently is, how many logical qubits it
    exposes, an optional decoder tag, and its current quality.  Reuses
    `CarrierRef` (→ `TypeChecker.Block`) rather than inventing a parallel code
    representation. -/
structure Carrier where
  code         : CarrierRef

    a claimed quality. -/

  basis   : MagicBasis
  carrier : CarrierId
  quality : MagicQuality := {}
  deriving Repr, Inhabited

/-- A linear MAGIC RESOURCE: either a produced/injected `MagicState`, or a PENDING
    obligation imported from the mixed compiler (`Compiler.MagicObligation`, e.g. a
    deferred `T`-gate).  Pending obligations are representable so MagicQ outputs can
    later be paired against the compiler's obligations (see `dischargesObligation`);
    their gate-teleportation discharge is out of scope for this pass. -/

  | state   (s : MagicState)
  | pending (ob : Compiler.MagicObligation)

/-- A slot in the linear environment: an author-assigned id, the resource, and a

end MagicEnv

/-! ## §4. Logical observables and postselection conditions. -/

/-- A logical-observable AXIS.  Ordinary Pauli checks REUSE `PPM.PLetter`; `hxy` is
    the NON-Pauli cultivation check `H_XY = (X+Y)/√2`, whose +1 eigenstate is the
    logical `|T⟩ = T|+⟩` and whose −1 eigenstate is `Z|T⟩` (2409.17595: the color
    code's transversal `H_XY`, measured by a GHZ-controlled transversal-`H_XY`
    "double-check" that raises the T state's fault distance).  `hxy` is NOT a Pauli
    and must not be faked as a `PPM.PLetter`. -/
inductive LogicalAxis
  | pauli (letter : PPM.PLetter)   -- an ordinary logical Pauli check (reuses PPM.PLetter)
  | hxy                            -- the non-Pauli H_XY = (X+Y)/√2 T-basis check
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-- A logical OBSERVABLE on a carrier: the `idx`-th logical qubit and its axis (an
    ordinary Pauli, or the non-Pauli `hxy` T-basis check).  Used by a logical
    check/measurement op. -/
structure LogicalObs where
  idx  : Nat
  axis : LogicalAxis
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-- A recursive POSTSELECTION PREDICATE at the MagicQ level: a Boolean composition
    (`and`/`or`/`not`) over DETECTOR/SYNDROME-NAME atoms.  This is the GENERAL postselection
    language at the MagicQ level; it lowers to `LS.PostPolicy.byPred`.

    HONESTY: MagicQ v1 has a FLAT detector/syndrome namespace and NO detector TAGS (its ops
    emit detector NAMES, not tags), so there is deliberately NO `tag` atom here — true
    detector tags are an LS-only concept (`LS.PostPred.tag`) and exposing one in MagicQ would
    be a name-alias masquerading as a tag.  Only the atom SCOPE is checked (every atom
    references a detector/syndrome produced by a prior op); the predicate's Boolean VALUE is a
    runtime/decoder fact and is never evaluated here.  A decoder GAP is deliberately NOT an
    atom — it stays the separate deferred `decoderGap` obligation, so it can never look
    proven. -/
inductive PostPred
  | detector (name : String)   -- atom: a named detector/syndrome fired
  | and      (p q : PostPred)  -- conjunction
  | or       (p q : PostPred)  -- disjunction
  | not      (p : PostPred)    -- negation
  deriving Repr, DecidableEq

/-- A POSTSELECTION condition.  These refer to detectors/syndromes produced by
    PRIOR ops; the checker verifies that scope.

    * `fullDetectors`   — early FULL postselection: ANY detector event discards
      the attempt (cultivation's early stages, 2409.17595 §III).
    * `syndromeEq n v`  — a named syndrome equals a value (e.g. the RM-15 `η = 0`).
    * `taggedDetectors name` — COMPATIBILITY syntax for a detector-NAME subset/alias.  MagicQ
      v1 has NO true detector-tag production/tracking, so this is NOT an LS `.byTag`: it is
      scope-checked against produced detector NAMES and lowers to `LS.PostPolicy.byDetector`.
      True LS detector tags remain LS-only until MagicQ gains tag-producing ops.
    * `predicate p`     — a general Boolean predicate over detector/syndrome-NAME atoms
      (MagicQ v1 has no tag atom — see `PostPred`; scope-checked; lowers to
      `LS.PostPolicy.byPred`).
    * `decoderGap thr`  — keep/reject on a decoder GAP ≥ threshold: a DEFERRED
      decoder obligation, never discharged here. -/

    existing `TypeChecker.checkSwitchWithDistance` (see `MagicQ.checkBlockSwitch`). -/

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- A protocol OPERATION.  Carrier/resource ids are author-assigned (no parser in
    this pass); the checker validates uniqueness, scope, liveness, arity and
    linearity.

    Carriers and resources are explicit so the AST is general enough for BOTH
    families: cultivation (`inject`→`checkLogical`→`grow`→`stabilize`→`graft`→
    `postselect`→`output`) and standard 15-to-1 (`inject`×15 → `measureSyndrome` →
    `postselect` → `output`).  15-to-1 is a LIBRARY composition of primitives, not a
    single op. -/

  /-- A DEFERRED-ASSUMPTION logical check: a logical observable whose legality the
      type system CANNOT yet prove (e.g. the non-Pauli `H_XY` T-basis check on a
      color code with no materialised transversal-`H_XY` evidence).  Accepts at the

      `.block` targets are rejected for lack of a certificate), this op carries a real
      `SwitchTarget` and is validated by `TypeChecker.checkSwitchWithDistance`, threading
      the post-switch `TypedEnv`.  Emits `detector`. -/

      `outCarrier` (code `outCode`).  `syndromes` NAMES the detectors the measurement fires
      (e.g. the RM-15 `η`), which become postselectable and are each recorded as a deferred
      syndrome-decoding obligation.  GENERIC over the input count: the "exactly 15" of
      Bravyi–Kitaev 15-to-1 is a property of the `rm15_to_1` LIBRARY protocol, NOT of this
      primitive.  Does NOT self-stamp the output distance (so an inflated distance claim on the
